# Android To-Do List App (Stable Release)

This branch contains the stable and functional versions of the To-Do list app. It is intended for release and distribution. All features in this branch have been tested and are considered stable for use in production environments. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks, with the ability to set deadlines using a popup calendar. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy to track and complete tasks.

The task deadline feature allows users to select specific dates for tasks, helping with task prioritization and time management. The interface is designed to be minimalist and easy to navigate, providing a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used:
The app is built using Kotlin, which provides a modern and efficient approach to Android app development.
